    <h2 class="centertext" >Animatic Preloader</h2>

    <div class = "descriptions center centertext"> 
        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>The purpose of this project was to create a seamless preloader animatic (GIF). I chose to recreate the Valorant logo.</p>
        <h3>Timeline</h3>
        <p>Three days.</p>
        <h3>Research</h3>
        <p>This was a beginner project to help get started and familiar with Adobe After Effects. I learned the basic tools, hot keys and shortcuts, and how to make the seamless loop animate with keyframes along the timeline.</p>
        <h3>Tools Used</h3>
        <p>Adobe After Effects<br>Adobe Illustrator</p>
        <h3>Deliverables</h3>
        <p>The final product is a seamless loop animation of the Valorant logo. The components are animated to create the full logo and then fade into the background until it restarts again.</p>

    <h2 class="centertext" style= "margin-top: 100px;">Kinetic Typography</h2>
    <div class = "descriptions center centertext"> 
        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>The purpose of this project was to create a 30-second kinetic typography video. Different animations and animated type were created to fit the song selection, 'Teeth' by 5 Seconds of Summer. </p>
        <h3>Timeline</h3>
        <p>April 2021</p>
        <h3>Research</h3>
        <p>A lot of research was done for this project. General After Effects tutorials were used to understand and get the hang of the software. Specific tutorials, especially for the moving stick figure were used to understand the movements of the arms and legs in the right spots. Timing also played a big factor since the song was very upbeat and fast, so elements had to timed correctly to the right lyrics and beats. These are some storyboards that I created to figure out what I wanted to create and animate for this video.</p>

            <img src = "portfolio-work/kinetictypography/roughwork-02.jpg" class = "roughwork">
        </div>
        <h3>Tools Used</h3>
        <p>Adobe After Effects<br>Adobe Illustrator</p>
        <h3>Deliverables</h3>
        <p>The final deliverable for this project was a 40-second video to the beginning of the selected song. Small and different animations were created throughout the video and the typography can be seen accurately according to the rhythm of the song.</p>
